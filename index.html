            <p>I help people deliver software in a way that's understandable, testable, scalable, and correct.</p>

            <p>I've recently become an independent contractor specialising in the financial domain. 
            With Barclays Wealth I've been creating SOA applications with an innovative distributed database design using the Scrum methodology. 
            During this contract I've trained people to adopt TDD and piloted a change to using BDD within the testing group to improve collaboration.</p>

            <p>In 2006, I joined JPMorgan Chase to help their Investment Bank use agile practices to drive business more effectively and efficiently. 
            In May 2010 I was selected to join their elite Expert Engineer program to focus on difficult problems seen within the bank.</p>

            <p>I blog at code.joejag.com and have started offering one to one mentoring on TDD after having success running Code Retreats.
            For the last few years I've been speaking at conferences about techniques such as Continuous Delivery and engaging in "deliberate practice" which organisations and developers can use to improve their skills and delivery.</p>

            <p>In my career I've spent 7 years developing software for the finance, micro-biology and education sectors using many architectural styles and development methodologies. 
            I have been creating web-based content, personally and professionally, since 1996.</p>

        Developing a SOA application to provide client data to other consumer and provider systems backed by a distributed cache. 
        This project reduces the cost of integration and improves the availability of client data.</p>

        <p>Used Continuous Delivery practices to automate the release process of a vendor system allowing the whole group to perform releases in minutes rather than days.</p>

        <p>Worked closely with the testing team to allow them to adopt practices such as version control and CI. Created a pull system for deployment to empower the team. 

        <p>Provided advice and training on agile retrospectives, deployment automation and BDD.</p>

        Senior developer with build, plan and delivery responsibilities.

        <p>Drove a firm wide initiative for improving code quality and developer tooling. This led to improved
            testing practices and reduced licence costs across the firm.

        <p>Developed applications for traders to mark up price correlations with Eclipse RCP and web services,
            resulting in decreased risk for commodities trading.

        <p>Created yield curve smoothing applications for the back office using Spring MVC and JQuery. This allowed for
            a reduced end of day process for the Back Office.

        <p>Drove adoption of XP based agile practices like CI, TDD and Pair programming across different lines of business.
