            <p>I help people deliver software that's well designed, fully tested and released early.</p>

            <p>Over the last six months I've being working as an agile coach with Emergn helping them with a technical transformation at a large public sector company.

            <p>Recently I joined a startup to help them get their first product out to market, taking advantage of the cloud technologies that are enabling companies to rapidly release software.

            <p>Before contracting, I joined JPMorgan Chase to assist their investment bank using XP agile practices to drive business more effectively and efficiently. 
            In May 2010 I was selected to join their elite Expert Engineer program to focus on difficult problems seen within the bank.</p>

            <p>I blog at code.joejag.com and have started offering one to one mentoring on TDD and OOD after success running Code Retreats.
            I'm known for speaking at conferences about techniques such as Continuous Delivery and engaging in "deliberate practice" which organisations and developers can use to improve their skills and delivery.</p>
