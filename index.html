            <p>I help people deliver software in a way that's understandable, testable, scalable, and correct.</p>

            <p>Since 2011 I've been an independent contractor specialising in the financial domain. My first contract has been with Barclays Wealth working on an SOA based application with an innovative distributed database design.</p>

            <p>In 2006, I joined JPMorgan to help their Investment Bank use agile practices to drive business more effectively and efficiently. In May 2010 I was selected to join their elite Expert Engineer program to focus on difficult problems seen within the bank.</p>

            <p>I also blog at tech.joejag.com and, on occasion, speak at conferences about why developers should engage in "deliberate practice" to improve their skills.</p>

            <p>In my career I've spent 7 years developing software for the finance, micro-biology and education sectors using many architectural styles. I have been creating web-based content, personally and professionally, since 1996.</p>
