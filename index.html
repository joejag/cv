            <p>I help people deliver software that's well designed, fully tested and released early.</p>

            <p>As an accomplished developer, I coach teams to adopt agile practices with a focus on XP, clean code and continuous delivery. I am adept to change roles between coach, developer, architect or tester to demonstrate where the challenges are and work with teams to solve them.</p>

            <p>Since 2015, I've been specialising in helping legacy teams with monolithic codebases. By targeting the culture of the teams, removing anything that they fear while improving the technical capabilities of the team.

            <p>I blog at code.joejag.com and via meet ups and conferences help to create a thriving code craftsmanship community in Glasgow.
            I'm known for speaking at conferences about techniques such as technical leadership, continuous delivery and mob programming.</p>

        Working across mulitple teams to help improve their technical practices and ability to deliver in newly service aligned environment.

        <p>Each team provides it's own context and challenges, but common improvements were training on how to effectively pair and mob program. This had the effect of breaking down knowledge silos and quickly creating team consensus on how to work together.</p>
            
        <p>From a process perspective I trained teams how to make accurate predictions for delivery without the need to estimate any tasks by using Monte Carlo simulation and data they already had.</p>

        Helping protect vulnerable adults and children from folk who shouldn't have jobs with them, while also rehabilitating criminals so they can get back to work without unnecessary prejudice.

        <p>Worked on the search engine to identify candidates to known persons. Given the complex domain, I introduced example mapping and making work visible to help the team deliver with a shared understanding and without rework.

        <p>Worked on security controls to maintain criminal records data in the cloud.

        Joined the point of sale team and introduced mob programming and microservices to deal with a monolithic legacy codebase.
        This allowed the team to meet their two most significant targets that year and allow for other teams to pick up work.

        <p>Focussed on relentlessly making it safer for people to do work.
          Improved communication between an ops and dev team to the point where the ops team moved from distrust to suggesting a move to continuous deployment.</p>

        Replaced a heritage monolithic Java 1.4 application with a Clojure &amp; Java 8 Microservices platform.

        <p>Worked as a tech lead to create the new platform. There was a focus on enabling the current staff and improving the UX of the new system.

        <p>As part of a sharing culture, I trained people on regular expressions, build automation, Java 8 Lambdas and the Z Shell.
