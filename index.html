            <p>I help people deliver software that's well designed, fully tested and released early.</p>

            <p>As an accomplished developer, I coach teams to adopt agile practices with a focus on XP, clean code and continuous delivery. I am adept to change roles between coach, developer, architect or tester to demonstrate where the challenges are and work with teams to solve them.</p>

            <p>In 2015, I'm looking to continue to develop my skills as a technical leader while also creating a thriving code craftmanship community in Glasgow.

            <p>I blog at code.joejag.com and have started offering one to one mentoring on TDD and OOD after success running Code Retreats.
            I'm known for speaking at conferences about techniques such as Continuous Delivery and engaging in <em>deliberate practice</em> which organisations and developers can use to improve their skills and delivery.</p>
