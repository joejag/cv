            <p>I help people deliver software that's well designed, fully tested and released early.</p>

            <p>As an accomplished developer, I coach teams to adopt agile practices with a focus on XP, clean code and continuous delivery. I am adept at changing roles between the coach, developer, architect or tester to demonstrate where the challenges are and work with teams to solve them.</p>

            <p>Since 2015, I've been specialising in helping legacy teams with monolithic codebases. I target the culture of the teams, removing anything that they fear while improving the technical capabilities of the team.

            <p>I blog at code.joejag.com and via meetups and conferences help to create a thriving code crafters community in Glasgow.
            I'm known for speaking at conferences about techniques such as technical leadership, continuous delivery and mob programming.</p>

        I run the Engineering Productivity team at FanDuel. Our work involves training, introducing tooling, and occasionally intervening to improve our engineers' productivity.

        <p>Our big piece of work in 2021 was allowing all Engineers to have their own private development environment available within 3 seconds.</p>
        
        <p>Part of the responsibility is organising a Friday demo for over 100 Engineers, with external and internal speakers coming in to speak on topics like Kubernetes, CodeScene and Tech Leadership.</p>

        Working across multiple teams to help improve their technical practices and ability to deliver in a new service-aligned environment.

        <p>Each team provides its own context and challenges, but general improvements were training on how to expertly pair and mob program. These improvements had the effect of breaking down knowledge silos and quickly creating team consensus on how to work together.</p>
            
        <p>From a process perspective, I trained teams on how to make accurate predictions for delivery without the need to estimate any tasks by using Monte Carlo simulation and data they already had.</p>

        I worked on security controls to maintain criminal records data in the cloud and the search engine to identify candidates to known persons.

        Joined the point of sale team and introduced mob programming and microservices to deal with a monolithic legacy codebase.
        This allowed the team to meet their two most significant targets that year and allow for other teams to pick up work.

        <p>Focussed on relentlessly making it safer for people to do work.
          Improved communication between an ops and dev team to the point where the operations team moved from distrust to suggesting a move to continuous deployment.</p>

        Replaced a heritage monolithic Java 1.4 application with a Clojure &amp; Java 8 Microservices platform.

        <p>Worked as a tech lead, creating a new platform. There was a focus on enabling the current staff and improving the UX of the new system.

        <p>As part of a learning culture, I trained people on regular expressions, build automation, Java 8 Lambdas and the Z Shell.
